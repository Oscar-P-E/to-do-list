# TODO:

## Not Done:

-   Make it so that any isDone only shows in the logbook
-   Add display of due date if has it
-   Add display of priority if marked
-   Add event listeners to the main area for the following:
-   Clicking on a todo should expand it to show its details
-   Expanded todo should additionaly have:
    -   Description/Notes
    -   Start date
    -   Flag/priority button
    -   Delete button
    -   Projects/Areas button
-   Clicking on an expanded todo should edit what is clicked on
-   Clicking outside of an expanded todo should collapse it
-   Clicking on a project should open it in the main area view
-   Add button for creating new todos and projects in main area
-   New todos should be added to the inbox,
    -   or today if in today view
    -   or under parent project/area if in a project's/area's view (and marked as not in inbox)
-   Add button for creating new areas and projects in side area
-   Make a backend for saving data
-   NOW you can work on the look of the app
-   Look into adding animations (Theo's youtube video)
-   Look into adding drag and drop functionality for reordering todos and projects, possibly moving them to different areas/projects/views/etc.
    -   If too hard, look into adding a sort button for sorting by due date, priority, etc.
-   Look into adding checklists to todos
-   Look into adding search functionality
    -   Look into adding dark mode toggle

## Done:

-   Make it so that (on creation not modification) any item with a parent is not in the inbox
-   Add checkbox to todos and projects for marking as done
